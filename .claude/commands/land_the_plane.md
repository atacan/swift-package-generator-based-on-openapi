## Landing the Plane

Complete ALL steps below. The plane is NOT landed until `git push` succeeds. NEVER stop before pushing. NEVER say "ready to push when you are!" - that is a FAILURE.

**MANDATORY WORKFLOW - COMPLETE ALL STEPS:**

1. **File beads issues for any remaining work** that needs follow-up
2. **Ensure all quality gates pass** (only if code changes were made) - run tests, linters, builds (file P0 issues if broken)
3. **Update beads issues** - close finished work, update status
4. **PUSH TO REMOTE - NON-NEGOTIABLE** - This step is MANDATORY. Execute ALL commands below:
   ```bash
   # Pull first to catch any remote changes
   git pull --rebase

   # If conflicts in .beads/beads.jsonl, resolve thoughtfully:
   #   - git checkout --theirs .beads/beads.jsonl (accept remote)
   #   - bd import -i .beads/beads.jsonl (re-import)
   #   - Or manual merge, then import

   # Sync the database (exports to JSONL, commits)
   bd sync

   # MANDATORY: Push everything to remote
   # DO NOT STOP BEFORE THIS COMMAND COMPLETES
   git push

   # MANDATORY: Verify push succeeded
   git status  # MUST show "up to date with origin/main"
   ```

   **CRITICAL RULES:**
   - The plane has NOT landed until `git push` completes successfully
   - NEVER stop before `git push` - that leaves work stranded locally
   - NEVER say "ready to push when you are!" - YOU must push, not the user
   - If `git push` fails, resolve the issue and retry until it succeeds
   - The user is managing multiple agents - unpushed work breaks their coordination workflow

5. **Clean up git state** - Clear old stashes and prune dead remote branches:
   ```bash
   git stash clear                    # Remove old stashes
   git remote prune origin            # Clean up deleted remote branches
   ```
6. **Verify clean state** - Ensure all changes are committed AND PUSHED, no untracked files remain
7. **Choose a follow-up issue for next session**
   - Provide a prompt for the user to give to you in the next session
   - Format: "Continue work on bd-X: [issue title]. [Brief context about what's been done and what's next]"

**REMEMBER: Landing the plane means EVERYTHING is pushed to remote. No exceptions. No "ready when you are". PUSH IT.**

**Example "land the plane" session:**

```bash
# 1. File remaining work
bd create "Add integration tests for sync" -t task -p 2 --json

# 2. Run quality gates (only if code changes were made)
go test -short ./...
golangci-lint run ./...

# 3. Close finished issues
bd close bd-42 bd-43 --reason "Completed" --json

# 4. PUSH TO REMOTE - MANDATORY, NO STOPPING BEFORE THIS IS DONE
git pull --rebase
# If conflicts in .beads/beads.jsonl, resolve thoughtfully:
#   - git checkout --theirs .beads/beads.jsonl (accept remote)
#   - bd import -i .beads/beads.jsonl (re-import)
#   - Or manual merge, then import
bd sync        # Export/import/commit
git push       # MANDATORY - THE PLANE IS STILL IN THE AIR UNTIL THIS SUCCEEDS
git status     # MUST verify "up to date with origin/main"

# 5. Clean up git state
git stash clear
git remote prune origin

# 6. Verify everything is clean and pushed
git status

# 7. Choose next work
bd ready --json
bd show bd-44 --json
```

**Then provide the user with:**

- Summary of what was completed this session
- What issues were filed for follow-up
- Status of quality gates (all passing / issues filed)
- Confirmation that ALL changes have been pushed to remote
- Recommended prompt for next session

**CRITICAL: Never end a "land the plane" session without successfully pushing. The user is coordinating multiple agents and unpushed work causes severe rebase conflicts.**
