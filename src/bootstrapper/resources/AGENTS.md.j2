We generate the Swift code using swift-openapi-generator. As we apply complex transformations to the original OpenAPI specification, we use a Python tool to do this. Run the generation with 

```bash
make regenerate
```

As this is a Swift package, you can find the code of the Swift package dependencies in the ".build/checkouts" directory. Look at that folder when you need to understand how to use the code from the Swift package dependencies.
